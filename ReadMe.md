## Environment Setup
For .pdb debugging it is expected that you work from `P:\unity-utilities` so that the source files can be resolved.

If you are going to be commiting DLLs or want to debug code inside the DLLs, you will need to do the following:

1. Open CMD.
2. Map the parent folder of your unity-utilities repository folder to the drive letter P:  
`SUBST P: [`Parent dir of unity-utilities project`]`  
If the path of the unity-utilities project is C:\Users\Bob\Projects\unity-utilities, the command would be:  
`SUBST P: C:\Users\Bob\Projects`
3. Navigate to P:\unity-utilities to make sure the mapping has worked.
4. Remember to always use this path when working on unity-utilities!

## Conventions
- Work from P:\unity-utilities.
- Commit .pdb files when committing .dlls.
- Each Utility project must have its own folder within unity i.e:  
  For [My Utility].csproj and Editor Only [My Utility].Editor.csproj
  - **Assets**
    - **[My Utility]**
      - **Plugins**

          - **[My Utility].dll.meta**: *commit this*
          - **[My Utility].Editor.dll**: *don't commit this*
          - **[My Utility].Editor.dll.meta**: *set this to Editor Only and commit this*
      - **Prefabs**
      - **Scenes**
      - **Resources**:
        - **[My Utility]**: *so resources of [My Utility] will be laoded with `Resources.Load([My Utility]/[resource 1])`*
