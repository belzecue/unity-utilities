# Feedback Panel
## Function 
A customisable panel for getting users to send feedback in game to a specified email using ElasticEmail.
## Usage
Setup for this asset is within the PlayGen.Unity.Utilities.FeedbackPanel Solution. By default it uses generic details, this is set in ElasticEmailClient.cs. Once rebuilt, the prefab can be added to the project and visuals edited as required.
## Gotchas
- If making this available public, make generic details available to developers in-editor/code, unusable otherwise.
